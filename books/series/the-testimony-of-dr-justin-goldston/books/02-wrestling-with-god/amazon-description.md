Wrestling with God is a first-person theological testimony of surrender, forgiveness, and the God who stayed.

It’s what happens when you stop performing faith and start telling the truth—about grief, anger, fear, and the kind of love that has to mature into discipline and boundaries.

This is not a legal filing.
This is not a story told to “win.”
This is a testimony told to stay whole.
