# The Goldstonian Concordance Bible: Volume V — Jesus, the Church, and the Walk

**This is not a fear-book. It’s a walk-book.**

**Volume V — Jesus, the Church, and the Walk** is where the promise steps into history and then trains a people. After Volumes I–IV build the covenant world, Volume V turns the whole series “toward the sun”: Jesus Christ revealed in the Gospels, the Spirit-formed movement in Acts, the Church’s mind-and-life formation in the Letters, endurance without panic in Revelation, and a practical **Walking Rule** that makes discipleship real at home and in public.

Built for clarity, preaching, deep study, and daily formation, this volume follows a consistent **Concordance Spine**:

- Purpose Thesis  
- Narrative / Argument Flow  
- Core Theology  
- Messiah Thread  
- Cross-Links  
- Hard Questions  
- Preacher’s Toolkit  
- Walking Rule Tie-In  

## Inside you’ll find

- **Four Gospel profiles** (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John) plus a **Gospel Harmony Map** you can actually use.
- **Acts, Paul’s letters, the General Epistles, and Revelation**—as a unified formation engine for the Church.
- **Ethiopian New Testament formation materials** *(Sinodos, Dominos, Clement, Didascalia)* treated as church-shaping discipleship scaffolding—guarding against chaos without structure and structure without compassion.
- **Part VII: The Walking Rule** — a practical Rule of Life for personal, family, community, and public witness discipleship.
