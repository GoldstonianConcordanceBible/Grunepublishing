abstract: >
  The Goldstonian Concordance Bible: Volume V — Jesus, the Church, and the Walk is where the promise steps into history
  and then trains a people. After Volumes I–IV build the covenant world, Volume V turns the whole series “toward the sun”:
  Jesus Christ revealed in the Gospels, the Spirit-formed movement in Acts, the Church’s mind-and-life formation in the Letters,
  endurance without panic in Revelation, and a practical “Walking Rule” that makes discipleship real at home and in public.
  Built for clarity, preaching, deep study, and daily formation, this volume follows a consistent Concordance Spine
  (Purpose Thesis, Narrative Flow, Core Theology, Messiah Thread, Cross-Links, Hard Questions, Preacher’s Toolkit, Walking Rule Tie-In).
  This is not a fear-book. It’s a walk-book.
