# Privacy, Names, and Identifying Details

To protect privacy (especially involving a minor):
- No full legal names of private individuals
- No addresses, schools, medical details, or account numbers
- No doxxing, harassment, or calls to action

If a name appears, it is either:
- A public figure in a public context, or
- A pseudonym, or
- A non-identifying reference

This series is about my life and my experience.
