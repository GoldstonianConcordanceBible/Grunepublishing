Since 1891, New Light Missionary Baptist Church in Greensboro, North Carolina has stood as a pillar of faith, hope, and community. Now, in the 21st century, its legacy continues through a bold new vision: The New Light Experiment.

This BlackBook is not about speculation, profit, or hype. It is about souls. It is a theological and philosophical framework that transforms Web3, blockchain, and gamification into sacred tools of discipleship, rehabilitation, and love.

Guided by the ministry partnership of Runic Consulting and the church’s heritage of innovation, this book lays out a 20-chapter roadmap for how troubled youth can be engaged, healed, and empowered through a new system:

Tokens as Testimonies — every act of service, prayer, or study logged immutably as proof of growth.
Quests as Discipleship — gamified rituals that guide youth step by step from Seed to Lightbearer.
DAO Governance as Training — troubled youth becoming tomorrow’s spiritual and civic leaders.
Fair Launch Tokenomics — no speculation, no pre-sale, no insiders. Only a covenant of love and accountability.
Anchored in Scripture and infused with Dr. Justin Goldston’s Post-Theism and Web3 Systems Thinking, this book reveals how ancient faith can meet modern tools without compromise. It insists that the church must meet youth where they are — on-chain, online, and in the digital commons — to bring them back to center, back to God.

The New Light Experiment is not just a project. It is a covenant. A system of love that cannot be corrupted, front-run, or lost — because it is rooted in God’s eternal promise to redeem His children.

✝️ To God be the glory. Back to center. Back to God.
