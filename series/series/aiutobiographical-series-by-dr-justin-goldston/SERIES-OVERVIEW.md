# Series Overview

This series is a receipts-first testimony of a father’s pursuit of truth, peace, and the ability to remain fully present in his daughter’s life—told without polish, without pity, and without performance.

Built on a ruthless premise—“the devil knows the Bible too”—this series separates Scripture from spin, faith from manipulation, and religious language from moral reality.

This is not reconciliation marketing.
This is testimony.
