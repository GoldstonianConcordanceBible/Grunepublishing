On November 19, 2025, Dr. Justin Goldston will step onto the TEDxSaintLouisUniversityMadrid stage with a message that has been building for years: Philosophy in Action.

If you arrived here from that TEDx talk, know this: the epic that got you here is true. What began under flickering lights in a mall parking lot has become a movement, a theory, and a summons to live philosophy, not posture it.

This is not just Dr. Justin Goldston’s story. This is The Epic of GigaNiga—a saga of faith, rebellion, and resurrection that insists systems must bring us back to center, back to God.

Inside these pages you’ll discover:

The origin story of the Web3 Systems Thinking Theory, born on asphalt, not in ivory towers.
How censorship, banned manuscripts, and erased archives became the crucible for resurrection.
Why philosophy must leave the page and take the stage—or it isn’t philosophy at all.
This isn’t autobiography. It’s testimony. It’s covenant. It’s The Epic of GigaNiga—and it’s also free with Kindle Unlimited.

Because the greatest story ever told is still being written.
