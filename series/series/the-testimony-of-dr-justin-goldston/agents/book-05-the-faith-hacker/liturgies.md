# Daily Liturgy (Mirror → Water → Fire)
For: REBUILDING + HABITS + PEACE SYSTEMS

## MIRROR (Truth)
**Breath:** Inhale 4… hold 2… exhale 6 (x3)  
**Truth line:** “Small steps rebuild strong foundations.”  
**Ask:** What truth do I need to accept today?

## WATER (Cleanse)
**Rebuild prayer:** “God, rebuild me with wisdom and patience. Wash out fear and restore discipline.”  
**Journal (3 lines):**
1) Truth: what’s real?
2) Rhythm: what small practice today?
3) Boundary: what do I refuse?

## FIRE (Forward)
**Plan step (10 minutes):**
- 5 minutes: one repeatable practice (read, pray, walk, journal)
- 5 minutes: one stability task (calendar, meal, room reset)
**Blessing:** “I will become consistent.”  
**Scripture references (optional):** Matthew 7; Romans 12; Psalm 1
