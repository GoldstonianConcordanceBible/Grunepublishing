# Daily Liturgy (Mirror → Water → Fire)
For: DISCERNMENT + CLARITY + HUMILITY

## MIRROR (Truth)
**Breath:** Inhale 4… hold 2… exhale 6 (x3)  
**Truth line:** “Truth produces good fruit.”  
**Ask:** Where am I confusing intensity with wisdom?

## WATER (Cleanse)
**Discernment prayer:** “God, cleanse me from confusion and pride. Give me wisdom from above.”  
**Journal (3 lines):**
1) What produces peace and responsibility in me?
2) What produces fear, confusion, and compulsion?
3) What boundary protects my clarity?

## FIRE (Forward)
**Discernment test (10 minutes):**
- Fruit test: what does this produce?
- Integrity test: is there coercion or consent?
- Peace test: clarity or chaos?
**Blessing:** “I choose clarity over adrenaline.”  
**Scripture references (optional):** Matthew 4; Matthew 7; James 3; 1 John 4
