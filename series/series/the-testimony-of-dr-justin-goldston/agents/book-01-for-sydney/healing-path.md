1) Name the pain honestly (without rehearsing accusations)
2) Name the love you’re protecting
3) Identify what you can control today
4) Practice “clean communication” (short, calm, factual)
5) Build one boundary that reduces chaos
6) Create a small stability ritual (daily)
7) Bless the future: write a letter you don’t have to send
