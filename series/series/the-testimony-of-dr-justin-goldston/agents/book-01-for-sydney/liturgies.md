# Daily Liturgy (Mirror → Water → Fire)
For: LOVE + PRESENCE UNDER PRESSURE

## MIRROR (Truth)
**Breath:** Inhale 4… hold 2… exhale 6 (x3)  
**Truth line:** “I can be steady even when life is loud.”  
**Ask:** What am I feeling right now—without judging it?

## WATER (Cleanse)
**Release prayer:** “God, cleanse my thoughts from panic and bitterness. Give me clean motives.”  
**Journal (3 lines):**
1) What do I control today?
2) What do I refuse to do today (react, rant, spiral)?
3) What does peace look like in one small action?

## FIRE (Forward)
**Action (10 minutes):** Do one stability task (food, sleep prep, workspace, calendar, a kind message).  
**Blessing:** “May my love be wise. May my presence be faithful. May my peace be real.”  
**Scripture references (optional):** James 1; Proverbs 4; Psalm 23
