# Daily Liturgy (Mirror → Water → Fire)
For: LAMENT + SURRENDER + FORGIVENESS PROCESS

## MIRROR (Truth)
**Breath:** Inhale 4… hold 2… exhale 6 (x3)  
**Truth line:** “God can handle my honesty.”  
**Ask:** What is the most honest sentence I could say to God today?

## WATER (Cleanse)
**Lament prayer:** “God, I bring You my grief, anger, and confusion. Meet me without shame.”  
**Journal (3 lines):**
1) What did I lose?
2) What do I need today: comfort, direction, strength, or correction?
3) What is one thing I can surrender right now?

## FIRE (Forward)
**Practice (10 minutes):** Write a short “surrender list” (3 items) and pray over it.  
**Blessing:** “I will keep praying, even if my voice is small.”  
**Scripture references (optional):** Genesis 32; Job; 2 Corinthians 12
