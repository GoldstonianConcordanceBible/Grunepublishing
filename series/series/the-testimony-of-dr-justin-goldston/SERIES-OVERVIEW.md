# Series Overview

A receipts-first testimony of a father pursuing truth, peace, and the ability to remain fully present in his daughter’s life.

Core premise: “The devil knows the Bible too.”
This series separates Scripture from spin, faith from manipulation, and religious language from moral reality.

Not reconciliation marketing.
Testimony.
