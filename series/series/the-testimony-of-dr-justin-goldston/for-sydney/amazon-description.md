**For Sydney** is a first-person testimony from my real life—written for my daughter first, and for anyone fighting to stay whole while staying present.

This is not a hit piece.
This is not gossip.
This is not a legal filing.

It’s my story: faith under pressure, hard boundaries, hard prayers, and the pursuit of peace without pretending.
