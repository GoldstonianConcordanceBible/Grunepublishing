The Devil’s Doctrine of Distraction is a first-person testimony about what distraction does to faith, family, and peace—and what it takes to break free.

Sometimes the battle isn’t about losing belief.
It’s about losing focus.

This is not a legal filing.
This is not an accusation.
This is my lived experience—told to help others choose discipline, boundaries, and clarity.
