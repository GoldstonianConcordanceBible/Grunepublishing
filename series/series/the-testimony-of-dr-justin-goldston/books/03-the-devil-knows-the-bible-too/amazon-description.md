The Devil Knows The Bible Too is a first-person testimony built on one premise: spiritual language can be used to heal—or to manipulate.

This book is about discernment: separating Scripture from spin, faith from performance, and religious vocabulary from moral reality.

This is not a legal filing.
This is not a hit piece.
It’s my lived experience—told for anyone who needs clarity without chaos.
