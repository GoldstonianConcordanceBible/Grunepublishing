The Faith Hacker is a first-person testimony that turns lived experience into a practical path forward.

It’s about rebuilding: faith, peace, habits, boundaries, and identity—without pretending pain didn’t happen, and without turning your story into a weapon.

This is not a legal filing.
This is not a hit piece.
It’s my life, my experience, and the framework I used to keep going.
