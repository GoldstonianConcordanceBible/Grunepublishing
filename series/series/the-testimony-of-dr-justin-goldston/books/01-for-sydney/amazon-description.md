For Sydney is a first-person testimony written from my real life—made for my daughter first, and for anyone trying to hold onto truth and peace when life gets loud.

This is not a hit piece.
This is not gossip.
This is not a legal filing.

It is my story: love under pressure, hard decisions, hard prayers, and a steady commitment to show up with integrity—especially when it cost me.
