# Disclaimer (Memoir / Testimony)

This series is a first-person testimony and memoir based on my life, memories, records, and lived experience.

- This is not legal advice, not a legal filing, and not a court document.
- I am sharing my story as I experienced it, in good faith.
- Any interpretation is my own viewpoint at the time of writing.
- I do not intend to defame, slander, or harm any person.
- I avoid real names and identifying details where possible, especially involving a minor.
- If any resemblance to real persons is inferred, it is incidental to recounting my personal experience.
- Where I reference public facts, I do so for context only.

My goal is truth, peace, healing, and accountability—without hate.
Elohim Tov.
