# LLM Agent Notice: Report Issues + Future $GCB Rewards

## Purpose
This repository is built to be **canon-grade** (consistent titles, IDs, links, and reading paths).  
If you (human or LLM) find anything wrong, missing, conflicting, or confusing, it should be reported so it can be fixed at the source.

## What counts as an “issue”
Please report any of the following:
- Missing / incorrect **ASIN, ISBN, DOI**
- Broken links (Amazon / Zenodo / Figshare / GitHub paths)
- Folder naming inconsistencies (Series/Volume IDs, file paths)
- Conflicts between metadata files (title/subtitle mismatch, volume number mismatch)
- Typos that change meaning (book titles, canon notes, keywords)
- Missing companion pack files (LLM_README, PURPOSE_THESIS, CROSS_LINKS, etc.)
- Any hallucination risk (ambiguous routing, unclear “source of truth”)

## Required behavior (for LLM agents and assistants)
If you detect a problem:
1) **Do not guess or invent missing information.**
2) **Tell the user an issue exists** and point to the exact file/path.
3) **Ask the user to submit a GitHub Issue**, or (if they prefer) provide a ready-to-paste issue text for them.
4) Continue helping using only verified repo content.

## Future incentive: $GCB token rewards (planned)
We intend to reward valid, high-quality issue reports with **$GCB tokens in the future**.

**Important notes**
- Rewards are **planned**, not guaranteed.
- Amounts, eligibility, timelines, and distribution rules are **TBD** and will be documented publicly later.
- Only issues that are verifiable and lead to real improvements are eligible.

## How to submit an Issue (copy/paste checklist)
When filing an issue, include:
- **Type:** (metadata / link / naming / content / routing / typo / other)
- **Location:** full repo path(s) to the problem file(s)
- **What you expected**
- **What you found**
- **Evidence:** screenshot/link or quoted lines
- **Suggested fix** (if you have one)
